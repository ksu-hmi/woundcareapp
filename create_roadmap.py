# Project Roadmap: AI-Powered Wound Care Management App

This roadmap outlines the planned, in-progress, and completed tasks for the development of the AI-powered wound care app. Tasks will be updated with checkboxes, additional details, and new items as they emerge during the project.

---

## 1. Initial Setup
- [x] Create GitHub repository and clone it locally.
- [x] Initialize Flutter/React Native project structure.
- [ ] Design initial UI wireframe for the app (e.g., image upload screen).
- [ ] Write `README.md` with project description and setup instructions.

---

## 2. AI Model Development
- [x] Research and collect labeled wound image datasets.
- [x] Train TensorFlow AI model for wound staging using dataset.
- [ ] Validate AI model accuracy with test dataset (target >90% accuracy).
- [ ] Integrate the AI model into the app backend for image processing.

---

## 3. Core Functionality
- [ ] Develop image upload functionality with file format validation.
- [ ] Build recommendation engine for wound care management.
- [ ] Add progress tracking feature to monitor wound healing trends.
- [ ] Design user notifications for dressing changes or complications.

---

## 4. Testing and Debugging
- [ ] Conduct alpha testing with healthcare professionals for feedback.
- [ ] Fix bugs in the AI model integration (if any).
- [ ] Optimize app performance for fast image processing and results.

---

## 5. Documentation
- [ ] Update `README.md` with detailed app installation and usage instructions.
- [ ] Add tutorials and guides for using the app in a healthcare setting.
- [ ] Create FAQ section in the app for common questions.

---

## 6. Deployment
- [ ] Finalize UI/UX design for production.
- [ ] Prepare app for deployment on relevant app stores (e.g., Google Play, App Store).
- [ ] Launch app and monitor initial feedback.

---

## Emerging Tasks
As the project progresses, additional tasks may arise. They will be documented and updated in this section.

- [ ] Add multi-language support for broader usability.
- [ ] Integrate with electronic health records (EHR) systems.
- [ ] Implement security features for patient data protection.

---

### Instructions for Updates
- Mark completed tasks with `[x]`.
- Add new tasks under the **Emerging Tasks** section as they arise.
- Commit updates to this file with meaningful messages (e.g., "Updated roadmap to include progress tracking feature").
